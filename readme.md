This website was designed for Kellogg's KIEI 451 course by Emily Ralph. 

The purpose of this website is to highlight several of Emily's favorite recipes throughout the years, as well as Emily's cat, Betty.

Emily's motivations include her love of baking, frustrations at being cooped up at home, and appreciation for her cat Betty. 

Betty would also like to thank all of her adoring fans, as she still strives to achieve world domination.
